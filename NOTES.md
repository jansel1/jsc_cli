# Notes:

What I plan to achieve for JSC Alpha. 1.0 Beta:
    * Tons of commands

# Current bugs:
1. commands crashing if Marg (nvm, just enable try and except lol)
2. some commands arent working (new ones)
3. not a bug but i gotta change the default window size to a square
4. Printing and qoutes

# More

JSC isn't made for printing - theres a FUCK ton of bugs there, it's made to do easy tasks with minimal effort.
Also, I'm not focused on speed right now, just want to lay out the core.
