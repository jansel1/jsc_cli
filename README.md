# JSC Alpha v1.0.0 
JSC is still in development, but you can install the Alpha version! Install it at http://jansel.pages.dev

# What is JSC?


JSC is a open-source Python CLI that helps with important tasks.
Most commands I made are kinda random, but there sure it a ton.


Thanks for installing!

# Debugging

If you can't install JSC through the website, here are some ways to fix this:
