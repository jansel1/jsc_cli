# JSC Alpha v1.0.0 
JSC is still in development, but you can install the Alpha version! Install it at http://jansel.pages.dev or on GitHub (listed on the website or just go to http://github.com/jansel1/jsc_cli)

(The version listed above is the current version - I might forget to update the version on the website)

This is a fully open-source project, feel free to send pull request!
# What is JSC?


JSC is a open-source Python CLI that helps with important tasks.
Most commands I made are kinda random, but there sure is a ton.

Thanks for installing!

# Debugging

If you can't install JSC through the website, here are some ways to fix this:

    * Re-open your browser
    * Refresh page
    * Install it from GitHub (github.com/jansel1/jsc_cli/)
